This folder contains excel files to summarize the data files available on the Stanford Open Policing Project website. 

The excel files contain information about which variables are available, whether the citation variable is valid(has both citation = True and citation = False data), etc.

The goal is to find out whether the same analysis can be applied to other states/cities in the Stanford open policing data as in Texas.
