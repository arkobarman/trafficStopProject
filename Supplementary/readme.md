This folder contains **supplementary** analysis for exploratory purpose that are not included in our current manuscript.

1. "supplementary_230723.ipynb" is the notebook that has:

- separate models for border counties and non-border counties
- models for most serious speeding offences
- (speeding-only) Separate Logistic Regression Models and Odds Ratio Plots for Metropolitan, Micropolitan, and Non-core
- Descriptive Stats of the Demographics from the Stops Data

The names of the jpg and csv outputs should explain themselves.

2. "ORCI_with_vios.csv" and "ORCI_with_vios.jpg" are the results when we include several violation types as independent variables to explain citation for all traffic stops. The violation types with more than 5000 records each year from 2006-2017 are included as variables, other violation types are all set to 'others'.
This is just for exploratory purpose. The results are generated by the same notebook for main results, ORCI.ipynb.
