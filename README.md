## Data
- The data can be extracted from [this website](https://openpolicing.stanford.edu/data/), in the form of a CSV or an RDS file. 
- For the purpose of this project, the *Texas State Patrol data* has been downloaded as an RDS file, and then converted into a parquet file. 
- The parquet file conversion is done on RStudio and the code for that is present in the repository, as a .R file named [Conversion_parquet_file.R](Conversion_parquet_file.R)

## Repository Structure
- This repository is currently under reconstruction. Archived folders can be found in the [replicated folder](replicated).
