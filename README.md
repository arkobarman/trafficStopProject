# Traffic Stop Project

This project focuses on inherent racial biases displayed by the police force, in different states of the U.S. So far, the data that has been examined is for Texas State Patrol Data.

## Data
-The data can be extracted from [this website](https://openpolicing.stanford.edu/data/), in the form of a CSV or an RDS file. 
-For the purpose of this project, the Texas State Patrol data has been downloaded as an RDS file, and then converted into a parquet file. 
-The parquet file conversion is done on RStudio and the code for that is present in the repository, as a .R [file](Conversion_parquet_file.R)
