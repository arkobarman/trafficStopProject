This folder contains [economic_regions_230802.ipynb](economic_regions_230802.ipynb) and the outputs it generates. This is just an exploration and a supplementary analysis that is not included in our manuscript.

The same analysis(citation/search conducted/contraband found ~ race + gender + county type) as the main results are applied to 12 economic regions in Texas: Alamo, Gulf Coast, Capital Region, Central Texas, High Plains, Metroplex Region, Northwest Texas, South Texas, Southeast Texas, Upper East Texas, West Texas and Upper Rio Grande Region.

Each region has a jpg file for odds ratios of race variables and a csv file for coefficient estimates, p values, etc.
