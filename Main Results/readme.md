#### This folder contains the main results that are currently included in our manuscript.

#### There are mainly four models in our analysis: 
[y_ORCI_ipynb_230804.ipynb](y_ORCI_ipynb_230804.ipynb)
- citation for all traffic stops; 
- citation for speeding-only stops;
[y_2_Search_230804.ipynb](y_2_Search_230804.ipynb)
- search conducted for speeding-only stops;
[y_3_Contraband_20230804.ipynb](y_3_Contraband_20230804.ipynb)
- contraband found for speeding-only stops

#### All the figures currently included in our manuscript can be found here, and the file name should explain itself. 

ORCI refers to race variables' odds ratios / confidence intervals with the citation variable as the target.

ORSC refers to race variables' odds ratios with the search conducted variable as the target.

ORCBF refers to race variables' odss ratios with contraband found variable as the target.

[new_county_type_citation.jpg](new_county_type_citation.jpg) summarizes [citation_speeding_Metropolitan.jpg](citation_speeding_Metropolitan.jpg), [citation_speeding_Micropolitan.jpg](citation_speeding_Micropolitan.jpg) and [citation_speeding_Non core.jpg](citation_speeding_Non core.jpg). The same model is run 3 times for 3 different county types.

"_speeding" suffix means it only includes speeding-only records in the analysis.

[new_ORCI_no_vios.jpg](new_ORCI_no_vios.jpg) includes all stops in the analysis.
